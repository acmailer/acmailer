This module provides an easy and flexible way to send emails from **Mezzio** and **Laminas MVC** applications (formerly known as Zend Expressive and Zend MVC). It allows you to pre-configure emails and transports, and then send those emails at runtime.

You will be able to compose emails from templates, and easily add attachments using different strategies.
